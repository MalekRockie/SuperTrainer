feat: restructure project into modular architecture with exercise extensibility

This commit reorganizes the codebase from a monolithic implementation to a modular system, enabling support for multiple exercise types. Key changes:

* Introduced proper separation of concerns with MVC-like architecture:
  - `controllers/` for business logic
  - `models/` for data structures and tracking
  - `views/` for UI components
* Implemented dynamic exercise configuration system:
  - Exercise definitions moved to `models/exercises.py`
  - Configurable angle thresholds and body sides
  - Support for unilateral/bilateral movements
* Created abstracted processing pipeline:
  - Generic pose detection in `PoseDetector`
  - Stateful rep counting in `RepCounter`
  - Dynamic joint angle calculation
* Added new exercise types:
  - Squats (lower body tracking)
  - Shoulder presses (vertical movement)
  - Push-ups (horizontal plane motion)
* Improved maintainability:
  - Clear file responsibilities
  - Type hints for critical interfaces
  - Centralized exercise parameters

The new structure allows adding exercises by simply extending the ExerciseConfig in exercises.py without modifying core processing logic.
